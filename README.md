This program is just a draft, so currently it's not an addition to the main program. In order to run it, add Newsubs.py to the 'program' folder containing all the other .py files and the config files and run it from the cmd prompt. It requires the existence of the merged video, having the name 'merged_video.mp4', and two srt files - one containing the extracted (or manually added) original subtitles - subs.srt, and one obtained from a previous step of the main program, through Format_srt.py, called "voice-else_subs.srt"
