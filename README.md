For running the script is necessary to keep the same configuration as presented in this branch:
A "test" folder, containing:
  - newcut.py
  - inaAnalysis.py
  - configfile.txt -> configuration file for newcut.py
  - **the movie input (called proba.mkv in this config file) and the srt file, if necessary**
The current path will be the path to this folder, 'test'

The root_path is leading to the folder containing:
  - folder test
  - configurationSpeed.txt
  - speedup.py
