To do:

!!find a method for sorting the frames properly (search lambda in creavideo)

after that combine summarize with creaVideo

ffmpeg filter does not detect different scenes, but changes => shot

speak recognizer - whisper

use conda for creating environment to test new functions (like whisper)
ex: write in cmd prompt "conda activate whisper"

keep tools separate
use one and switch to another environment

find solution to activate conda from something else than cmd line so you can make the process automated

solution to switch from an environment to another

for using whisper, to diff music/silence/voice use a detector, also detects male and female voices (see on gmail) => ina speech segmenter

extract mp3 from movie and process it with ina speech with ffmpeg
